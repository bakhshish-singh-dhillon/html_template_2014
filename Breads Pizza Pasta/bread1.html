  PANEER</u></p>
  <p><img src="pics/bread1.jpg" width="500" height="400"></p></td>
    <td><div style="height:400px;overflow:auto;"><p>INGREDIENTS<br>
  500 gm Refined flour<br>
  10 gm Salt<br>
  15 gm Fresh yeast<br>
  300 ml Water<br>
  200 gm Soft butter<br>
  200 gm Paneer (cottage cheese)</p>
  <p>METHOD<br>
    Sift the flour, salt and yeast into a bowl. Break the<br>
    butter in small chunks. Add the butter chunks to the<br>
    bowl. Rub these by hand. Make a well in the bowl.<br>
    Pour in the cold water, mixing until you have firm,<br>
    rough dough, adding extra water if needed. Cover<br>
    with a plastic wrap. Leave to rest for 20 minutes in<br>
    the refrigerator. Turn out into a lightly floured board.<br>
    Knead gently and form into a smooth rectangle. Roll<br>
    the dough in one direction only, until three times the<br>
    width, about 20 x 50cm. Keep edges straight and<br>
    even. Don't overwork the butter streaks; you should<br>
    have a marbled effect. Fold the top third down to the<br>
    centre, then the bottom third up and over that. Give<br>
    the dough a quarter turn (to the left or right) and roll<br>
    out again to three times the length. Fold as before,<br>
    cover with a plastic wrap. Chill for at least 20<br>
    minutes before rolling to use. Take out dough from<br>
    the refrigerator. Roll it to 4&quot; thickness. Next, cut it<br>
    into 2&quot; squares. Place in a greased baking tray. Keep<br>
    it for rising in room temperature for 1&frac12; hours. Set<br>
    MWO on HIGH. After it has grown in size, grate<br>
    paneer over the bread. Put the baking tray in the<br>
    MWO for 20 minutes. Check the colour of the bread.<br>
    Once golden brown, remove. Serve hot or cold as<br>
    desired.</p></td></div>

  <p><img src="pics/bread2.jpg" width="500" height="400"></p></td>
    <td><div style="height:400px;overflow:auto;"><p>INGREDIENTS<br>
  1 French loaf<br>
  5-6 cloves Garlic<br>
  100 gm Butter<br>
  15 gm Parsley</p>
  <p>METHOD<br>
    Finely chop the garlic and parsley. Put some butter in<br>
    a bowl and heat in the MWO on MEDIUM for 30<br>
    seconds. Take out the butter. Mix in the garlic and<br>
    parsley. Cut the French loaf as wedges. You can do<br>
    this by cutting 2cm thick pieces. While cutting,<br>
    remember not to cut down straight, but to cut<br>
    diagonally. Apply the butter mix on the wedges. You<br>
    could also add some cheese on the top and put it in<br>
    the MWO. Microwave on HIGH for 2 minutes.<br>
    Serve hot.</p></td></div>

<td width=40%><p><u>CHEESE BREAD</u></p>

    <td><div style="height:400px;overflow:auto;"><p>INGREDIENTS<br>
  For the Dough<br>
  6 cups Baking Flour<br>
  /Refined flour<br>
  1&frac12; cups Lukewarm<br>
  water<br>
  2 tsp Dry yeast<br>
  &frac12; cup Milk<br>
  2 tsp Sugar<br>
  1 tsp Salt</p>
  <p>METHOD<br>
    Combine flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a large mixing<br>
    bowl. Add water and oil to the dry ingredients.<br>
    Gently mix together using your fingers. Knead the<br>
    dough until soft, for about 6-7 minutes. Place in a<br>
    lightly greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Leave<br>
    aside for 45 minutes to rise. Put in MWO on<br>
    CONVECTION mode on LOW setting for 4-5 minutes.<br>
    Remove. Let it rise again till it doubles in size.<br>
    Remove dough from the bowl. Knead slightly. Shape<br>
    into a loaf. Fill in the pre-made filling. Again give it a<br>
    loaf shape. Gently place in the greased bread pan.<br>
    Cover with plastic wrap or a moist cloth. Let it rise<br>
    outside for 40 minutes. Preheat the MWO in<br>
    CONVECTION mode on HIGH setting. Brush the top<br>
    of the loaf with milk. Sprinkle grated cheese. Place<br>
    the loaf pan in the MWO. Bake on CONVECTION<br>
    setting on HIGH for 23&ndash;25 minutes. Check if the<br>
    bread is cooked by tapping the crust. If you hear a<br>
    hollow sound then the bread is cooked and ready.<br>
    Leave aside for 2 minutes to de-mould. Let it cool<br>
    before using.</p></td></div>
